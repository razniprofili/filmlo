  "In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, Ïƒ)
   shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average (mean, or expected value).
   A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean,
   whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large
   range of values."
